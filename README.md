## Creative Works

### Game Pitch
- **[Sinful](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vynmTaQE3kLal942TclcBb1cu3SBnk-d/view?usp=sharing)**: A game pitch I crafted demonstrating my creativity and flexible skillset.
As one of my class assignments I was asked to creat a pitch and proposal for a new game. *Sinful* is a fantasy RPG with roguelite mechanics and a turn-based combat system. The story centers around a fledling demon with dreams of becoming the next overlord of sin. The games targeted demographic is gamers 13-28 who enjoy challenging gameplay where choices throughout the game have a dramatic impact on the storyline. Mid-Fidelity protoype screens made with Figma.

### Childrens Book
- **[A Vibrant Life](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iqhhlrDHMhrJuUQo3DLyqb9Sb14Js99V/view?usp=sharing)**: A delightful story for young readers, showcasing my creativity and storytelling skills.
As part of my creative pursuits, I wrote a children's book titled *A Vibrant Life*. The story focuses on the grief of loss and to appreciate the precious things that you have. It is designed for readers aged 5-12. This project reflects my ability to create engaging, imaginative content for younger audiences.
