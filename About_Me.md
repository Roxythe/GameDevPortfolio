# About Me
![Airforce Graduation](./media/Service.jpg)
Over the years, I have gained work experience from a wide variety of industries while pursuing education to improve myself. During my time at **Dave & Busters**, I was recognized for my work with the **MVP Rookie award** for my diligence and strong work ethic no matter what position I was placed in during my first year's work. Throughout my time in the service industry, I learned the importance of **adaptability, customer service, and multi-tasking**. My supervisors frequently referred to me as a **low-maintenance employee with high self-efficiency**. They knew that if I was told to perform a task, they could be sure it would be completed quickly and satisfactorily, meeting or exceeding their standards. After learning of my responsibilities, I would complete all my tasks without the need for oversight.

During my time in the **United States Air Force**, I received multiple commendations and awards for my exemplary work:
- **Top Graduate** in my technical school.
- Qualified as an **Expert Marksman**.
- Earned the **Airman of the Quarter Award** twice while working in two different squadrons.
- Awarded twice by my commander in **Okinawa** and **Alconbury** for exceptional work that went above and beyond military standards.

While working in the Air Force, I refined my skills in **communication, teamwork, and leadership**. There were many times where I experienced firsthand how proper communication could make a profound difference in the efficiency of completing projects in a timely manner. Poor communication often led to confusion and created setbacks that could have been easily avoided with clarification. I had the good fortune of learning from leaders with over a decade of experience who chose to lead by example and were eager to share their knowledge to help subordinates grow into outstanding future leaders. While the military lifestyle was not something I was interested in following for a 20-year career, I have never regretted my decision to serve. I will cherish the valuable lessons I learned throughout my service and apply them to my future endeavors to be the best that I can be in my industry.
